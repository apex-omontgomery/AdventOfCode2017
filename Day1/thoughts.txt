The problem states that you need to check if the current number and the next one have the same value.

If two values in a row are the same add num_values* value to the count

If we iterate from 0-> end we will get almost correctly but we need the end case

Iterate from -1  until len(list) -1. That way we check the end condition twice.

current index + len(list) // 2 will go past index?

Use modulo to wrap around.
